## Computer Virus
A Computer virus is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code, documents or the boot sector of the hard drive. Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on "infected" hosts, such as stealing hard disk space or CPU time, accessing private information, corrupting data, rendering the computer useless and so on. However, not all viruses carry a destructive payload or attempt to hide themselves - the defining characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs which install themselves without user consent.

## Payload
Payload is the cargo of a [data transmission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission). It is the part of the transmitted data which is the fundamental purpose of the transmission, to the exclusion of information sent with it (such as headers or metadata, sometimes refferred to as overhead data) solely to facilitate delivery. In the analysis of malicious software such as worms, viruses and Trojans, it also refers to the software's harmful results. Examples of payloads include data destruction, messages with insulting text or spurious e-mail messages sent to a large number of people.
