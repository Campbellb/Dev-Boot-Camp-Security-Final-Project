# DDoS Attack

### What is a DDoS attack?
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. They target a wide variety of important resources, from banks to news websites, and present a major challenge to making sure people can publish and access important information.

### Types of Attacks
DDoS attacks come in many different forms, from [Smurfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurf_attack) to [Teardrops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Teardrop_attacks), to [Pings of Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_of_death). Below are details about the types of attacks and amplification methods found on the map:


#### Attack Class: Four common categories of attacks
- TCP Connection Attacks - *Occupying connections*  
These attempt to use up all the available connections to infrastructure devices such as load-balancers, firewalls and application servers. Even devices capable of maintaining state on millions of connections can be taken down by these attacks.
- Volumetric Attacks - *Using up bandwidth*  
These attempt to consume the bandwidth either within the target network/service, or between the target network/service and the rest of the Internet. These attacks are simply about causing congestion.
- Fragmentation Attacks - *Pieces of packets*  
These send a flood of TCP or UDP fragments to a victim, overwhelming the victim's ability to re-assemble the streams and severely reducing performance.
- Application Attacks - *Targeting applications*  
These attempt to overwhelm a specific aspect of an application or service and can be effective even with very few attacking machines generating a low traffic rate (making them difficult to detect and mitigate).


#### Amplification: Two ways attacks can multiply traffic they can send
- DNS Reflection - *Small request, big reply*  
By forging a victim's IP address, an attacker can send small requests to a DNS server and ask it to send the victim a large reply. This allows the attacker to have every request from its botnet amplified as much as 70x in size, making it much easier to overwhelm the target.
- Chargen Reflection - *Steady streams of text*  
Most computers and internet connected printers support an outdated testing service called Chargen, which allows someone to ask a device to reply with a stream of random characters. Chargen can be used as a means for amplifying attacks similar to DNS attacks above.
