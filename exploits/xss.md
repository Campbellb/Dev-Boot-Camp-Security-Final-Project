#Cross-site Scripting(XSS)
##What is it?
Cross-site scripting is a vulnerability in web applications where you "inject" a script in to the website that is viewed by other users, which can chain in to a [sessions hijacking](/sessions.md) exploit.

XSS is one of the most common and dangerous exploits out there, so it's really important to learn about it!


##Types of XSS

###Reflected(non-persistant)
The most common type of XSS. This exploit is made possible when the web application author fails to write in proper request sanitization when they are writing their code.

A reflected attack is typically delivered via email or a neutral web site. The bait is an innocent-looking URL, pointing to a trusted site but containing the XSS script. If the trusted site is vulnerable to the vector, clicking the link can cause the victim's browser to execute the injected script.

###Persistant
The persistent (or stored) XSS vulnerability is a more devastating variant of a cross-site scripting flaw: it occurs when the data provided by the attacker is saved by the server, and then permanently displayed on "normal" pages returned to other users in the course of regular browsing, without proper HTML escaping. A classic example of this is with online message boards where users are allowed to post HTML formatted messages for other users to read.

##Dangers of XSS:
Among many other things, the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript in another user's browser allows an attacker to perform the following types of attacks:

* Cookie theft
The attacker can access the victim's cookies associated with the website using document.cookie, send them to his own server, and use them to extract sensitive information like session IDs.

* Keylogging
The attacker can register a keyboard event listener using addEventListener and then send all of the user's keystrokes to his own server, potentially recording sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers.

* Phishing
The attacker can insert a fake login form into the page using DOM manipulation, set the form's action attribute to target his own server, and then trick the user into submitting sensitive information.
