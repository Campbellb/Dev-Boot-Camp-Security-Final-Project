# Malicious Software (Malware)
Malicious software is any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. Malware is sometimes used broadly against government or corporate websites to gather guarded information, or to disrupt their operation in general. However, malware is often used against individuals to gain information such as personal identification numbers or details, bank or credit card numbers, and passwords. Left unguarded, personal and networked computers can be at considerable risk against these threats. (These are most frequently defended against by various types of [firewall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)), anti-virus software, and network hardware).

## Computer Virus
A Computer virus is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code, documents or the boot sector of the hard drive. Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on "infected" hosts, such as stealing hard disk space or CPU time, accessing private information, corrupting data, rendering the computer useless and so on. However, not all viruses carry a destructive payload or attempt to hide themselves - the defining characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs which install themselves without user consent.

## Computer Worm
A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. Unlike a computer virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.  
Many worms that have been created are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through. However, as the [Morris worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm) and [Mydoom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mydoom) showed, even these "payload free" worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects. A "payload" is code in the worm designed to do more than spread the wormâ€”it might delete files on a host system (e.g., the ExploreZip worm), encrypt files in a [cryptoviral extortion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptovirology) attack, or send documents via e-mail. A very common payload for worms is to install a [backdoor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)) in the infected computer to allow the creation of a "zombie" computer under control of the worm author. Networks of such machines are often referred to as botnets and are very commonly used by spam senders for sending junk email or to cloak their website's address. Spammers are therefore thought to be a source of funding for the creation of such worms, and the worm writers have been caught selling lists of IP addresses of infected machines.

## Trojan horse
A Trojan horse, or Trojan, in computing is generally a non-self-replicating type of malware program containing malicious code that, when executed, carries out actions determined by the nature of the Trojan, typically causing loss or theft of data, and possible system harm. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the large wooden horse used to trick defenders of Troy into taking warriors concealed in the horse into their city in ancient Anatolia. The use of this name references how computer Trojans often employ a form of social engineering, presenting themselves as routine, useful, or interesting in order to persuade victims to install them on their computers.  
A Trojan often acts as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. While Trojans and backdoors are not easily detectable by themselves, computers may appear to run slower due to heavy processor or network usage. Malicious programs are classified as Trojans if they do not attempt to inject themselves into other files (computer virus) or otherwise propagate themselves (worm). A computer may host a Trojan via a malicious program that a user is duped into executing (often an e-mail attachment disguised to be unsuspicious, e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by [drive-by download](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_download).

## Payload
Payload is the cargo of a [data transmission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission). It is the part of the transmitted data which is the fundamental purpose of the transmission, to the exclusion of information sent with it (such as headers or metadata, sometimes refferred to as overhead data) solely to facilitate delivery. In the analysis of malicious software such as worms, viruses and Trojans, it also refers to the software's harmful results. Examples of payloads include data destruction, messages with insulting text or spurious e-mail messages sent to a large number of people.
