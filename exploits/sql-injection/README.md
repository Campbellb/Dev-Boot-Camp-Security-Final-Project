# SQL Vulnerabilities
A SQL Injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), and more!  

- Standard Injection
- Union Exploitation
- Error Based Exploitation
- Boolean Exploitation(Blind Injection)
- Time Delay Exploitation(Blind Injection)
  
etc.  
  

### Standard Injection
One of the most famous attacks are the `1=1 Always True` standard injections. If this injection is successful, the attacker will be able to pull out all the data from the current table. The sample below is a example of an injection from the URL.
```url
www.example.com/users/1' or 1=1--
```
  
*Standard Injection Sample*
![Standard Always True Injection sample](img/always-true.png)
*%27 and %20 is how the browser interpret ' and space*
  

Basicly SQL injections always start with a quote(`' or "`), because when the sample url above is used to query the database, the underlying SQL query will most likely to be a string like this.
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE users.id = '1'
```
Therefore, adding a quote to the end of the URL will end that query and you are able to add additional commands to it. `1=1` or `x=x` are the most seen examples but it doesn't matter what you put at both sides of the `=` as long as they are the same things. The result of this query will be always be `true`, which means that the database will take out everything it can find and that means *everything*.
The `--` after `1=1` is the comment syntax in SQL. By adding this to the end of the injection, it will comment out any other following commands after the injected query. Therefore the injected query will be the last thing for the database to see, and will give the hacker everything they are looking for.
  


### Union Exploitation
The Union operator is used in SQL injections to join a extra query to the original query purposely by the attacker. The result of the forged query will be joined with the original query and allows the attacker to gain access to the columns and values of other tables. An example of a Union Injection in the URL will look like this.
```url
www.example.com/users/1' union select 1,1 from vote--
```
The SQL query in the example above is trying to do something like this.
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE users.id = 1
UNION
SELECT 1, 1 FROM votes
```
What this query is trying to do is to first select a user from the user table with the id 1 *and also* select the column 1 and 1 from the table votes. I suppossed some people are confused at this point. What in the world does `1, 1` do? This is actually a combination of Union Exploitation and Error Based Exploitation (I will go into details about this later). In the place of `1, 1`, it would be replaced column names of the table the attacker is looking for. So I think it will make more sense if I write it like this.
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE users.id = 1
UNION
SELECT votes.id, votes.user_id FROM votes
```
This is an effective way of extracting values from the database when you know the name of the tables or columns.

*Abstract example*
```url
<URL>' union select <column name> from <table name>
```
  


### Error Based Exploitation
Error Based Exploitation are a way for an attacker to gain information about the database by intentionally passing the wrong syntax when injecting queries. It's a way for an attacker to guess what kind of tables or columns there are in the database when the attacker can't exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using techniques like the `Union Exploitation`.  
  
An example of an Error Based Exploitation on the URL will look like this.
```url
www.example.com/users/1' union select 1,1 from vote--
```
This look familiar doesn't it? That's right, this is one of the example I used in the Union Exploitation technique. You may wonder why I'm repeating this, but it will make sense if you take a look at the picture below.
  
*Error Based Exploitation sample 1*
![Union Exploitation sample 1](img/error-1.png)

The high lighted part in the URL is the same as the example above. If you take a look at the 2 smaller high lights, you can see that they are actually giving the attacker(which is me in this case) some information about the columns in the database. The error is telling us the type of the attribute of that table, so let's take a look at what will happen when we change one of the ones to a string instead of an integer?  

*Error Based Exploitation sample 2*
![Union Exploitation sample 2](img/error-2.png)

As you can see, the errors disappeared. So what the attacker will know from this process is that the first and second column is a integer type and a string type. This might not look threatening at this point, but if a attacker can gain information about the database this easily, getting all the values out just requires a few couple more of guesses and then the attacker can switch to other techniques like *Union Exploitation* to take out the values from the database.
  
  

### Boolean Exploitation
The Boolean Exploitation is a technique an attacker uses when they are in a **Blind SQL Injection** situation, in which nothing is known on the outcome of an operation. For example, this behavior happens in cases where the programmer has created a custom error page that does not reveal anything on the structure of the query or on the database. (The page does not return a SQL error, it may just return a HTTP 500, 404, or redirect).  
By observing the outcome of the page(whether it is a Error page or just a normal page), the attacker can get hints if his/her guess of the database is correct or not. Below is an example of a Boolean Exploitation.
```url
www.example.com/users/1' select * from users order by case when (select count(*) from sys.tables)<10 then users.id else users.name end desc--
```
The example uses a `case` statement, which is something similar to the `if else` condition. What the injection doing here is that, the attacker already knows that there is either an id or name column in the database, which means that at least one of the command will return a successful response when the query is injected. Thought the view might not change much, the attacker can still get some information about the database or check whether his/her guess is correct or not.  
The example below is a way the attacker can check for the first character of the column.
```sql
select * from <table name>
order by
case when (select top 1 ascii(substring(<column name>, 1, 1))
    from sys.tables)<=109
        then <columns name>
        else <column name>
    end
desc
```
The number `109` is the ASCII value of the lower case alphabet `m`.By changing the number due to the output, the attacker can actually guess the character of the table and columns using a Binary Search. And by automating this process, the attacker can figure out the database even though they can't get much information from the outputs.  
  


### Time Delay Exploitation
The Time Delay Exploitation is another technique an attacker can use when they find themselves in a **Blind SQL Injection** situation.  This technique also uses a condition query to check for something in the database and instead of doing some small changes to the view, the attacker delays the database response with a few seconds if the condition is true. That means that if the the page is delaying the response after the injection, the condition that the attacker is checking is correct and the attacker will know what there are in the database. The code below is a sample code for Time Delay Exploitation.
```
select * from supercar
order by
if (select top 1 ascii(substring([column name], 1, 1))
    from sys.tables)<=109
    waitfor delay '00:00:05'
desc
```
The code here can be exchanged with the Boolean Exploitation example shown above. If the condition is true, the database will delay 5 seconds before it response. In this case, the condition is to check whether the first character in a table is smaller than `m` or not. This technique will take a lot of time to finish executing but it gives you less chances of getting shutout by the target because you can't send a bunch of requests to the server in one second, which definitely is something a human can't do.
