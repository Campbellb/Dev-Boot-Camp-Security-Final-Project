##Our Mission Statement
DBC teaches the students to write web applications in Ruby on Rails -- security can sometimes be considered an afterthought. Our team decided to make this our main focus, and illuminate the security flaws in some of the web apps we are writing.

This is a compendium of all of the information we have learned - the common exploits, the security tools used, and other useful tips from the web security world. This can be used as a point of reference for people interested in learning more about this important topic.

##Table of Contents
###Common Exploits and Definitions
The world of Network Security can be a confusing place...
 Let us clear up some of your confusion by defining a few terms and providing examples of common exploits!
* [Penetration Testing](/pentesting.md) - What is this pentesting thing anyways?
* [White Hat vs. Black Hat](/hats.md) - Which hat do I wear?
* [Social Engineering](/socialengineering.md) - Tricking people into breaking normal security procedures
* [SQL Injection](/sql-injection/README.md) - An SQL Injection can destroy your database.

* [XSS](/xss.md) - Injecting malicious client-side scripts into Web pages
* [Fuzzing](/fuzzing.md) - Fuzzers automatically inject data into a program to detect bugs.
* [CVE's and 0-day's](/0day.md) - Security holes for which no solution is currently available.
* [Bug Bounties](/bugbounties.md) - Find exploits for fame and fortune!

###Security Tools
There are tons of security tools out there that you can play with! These are just a few that we've spent time researching - there are many, many more out there!
* [Burp](/burp.md) - man-in-the-middle app with many modules
* [recon-ng](/recon-ng.md) - regarded as one of the top tools for open source reconnaisance
* [BeEF](/beef.md) - a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser
* [w3af](/w3af.md) - an open-source web application security scanner
* [metasploit & kali linux](/metasploit.md) - The Hacker's OS!
* [Browser Extensions](/extensions.md) - Turn your browser into a hacking machine!
