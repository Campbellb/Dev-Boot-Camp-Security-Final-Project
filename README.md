##Our Mission Statement
DBC teaches the students to write web applications in Ruby on Rails -- security can sometimes be considered an afterthought. Our team decided to make this our main focus, and illuminate the security flaws in some of the web apps we are writing.

This is a compendium of all of the information we have learned - the common exploits, the security tools used, and other useful tips from the web security world. This can be used as a point of reference for people interested in learning more about this important topic.
