#Pentesting
##What Is Pentesting?
A penetration test, or the short form pentest, is an attack on a computer system with the intention of finding security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to it, its functionality and data.

Companies will hire teams of pentesters to asses their risk of being hacked, and to tell them what needs to be done to update their security.

Skilled penetration testers have mastery-level knowledge of the Internet, networks, programming languages(particularly scripting languages), and security tools.
