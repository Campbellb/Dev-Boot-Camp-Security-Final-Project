#Pentesting
##What Is Pentesting?
A penetration test, or the short form pentest, is an attack on a computer system with the intention of finding security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to it, its functionality and data.

Typically, companies will hire teams of pentesters to asses their risk of being hacked, and to tell them what needs to be done to update their security.

Skilled penetration testers have mastery-level knowledge of the Internet, networks, programming languages(scripting languages in particular), and security tools.

Pentesters typically possess **security certificates** that make sure they know the technology and in question. More information about pentesting certificates can be found [here](https://www.concise-courses.com/security/certifications-list/).

**Red Teams** are groups of hackers hired to assess networks or applications for security flaws. Red team exercises go further than penetration testing. Red team exercises have the goals of improved readiness of the organization, better training for defensive practitioners, and inspection of current performance levels. Independent red teams can provide valuable and objective insights about the existence of vulnerabilities and about the efficacy of defenses and mitigating controls already in place and even those planned for future implementation.
