#CVE
CVE, maintained by the MITRE Corporation, is a dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures. CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. The CVE system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures.

The CVE database, of all outlying vulnerabilities in software, can be found at the [CVE List Master Copy](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html).

CVE's are scored, known as the CVSS, from 0 to 10, based on how severe the vulnerability in question is.

#0-Day
A zero day vulnerability refers to a hole in software that is unknown to the vendor. This security hole is then exploited by hackers before the vendor becomes aware and hurries to fix it—this exploit is called a zero day attack. Uses of zero day attacks can include infiltrating malware, spyware or allowing unwanted access to user information. The term “zero day” refers to the unknown nature of the hole to those outside of the hackers, specifically, the developers. Once the vulnerability becomes known, a race begins for the developer, who must protect users.
