#Bug Bounties!
##What is it?
A bug bounty program is a deal offered by many website and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to exploits and vulnerabilities. 

Bug Bounties provide an understood relationship between the Developers and Security Researchers for the facilitation of responsibly disclosing bugs and exploits.

###Why have Bug Bounties?
Previously, there was no official way that people could report these bugs and exploits. Many companies didn't(and still don't) understand the importance of having security researchers probing their sites, and didn't have methods in for researchers to responsibly disclose these exploits. There were many cases where researchers would approach a company or developer with an exploit they found, and then the company would press charges against the researcher.

###Rewards
Gifts, like t-shirts or other swag are sometimes offered for the disclosure of exploits. Money is another common reward, usually from $500 up to $50,000, depending on the seriousness of the exploit in question.A company might also have a "Hall of Fame" leaderboard functionality to show off the people who report the most bugs.
