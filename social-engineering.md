In the context of information security, social engineering is the extraction of sensitive information by physical and psychological means. Although it often involves techniques used by penetration testers or in conjunction with a digital penetration attack, social engineering typically uses coercion and manipulation to obtain important information from unsuspecting individuals.

Social engineering is a multi-disciplinary field which combines knowledge of computer science, human psychology, and sociology. The term has most recently been coined by penetration testers who are tasked with infiltrating an organization on behalf of the organization itself to find security vulnerabilities often pertaining to technology that are not necessarily due to vulnerabilities in the technology itself but rather with ignorance or negligence on behalf of the organization's employees. For example, a login system might be resistant to computer penetration attempts but employees might be prone to giving out sensitive information to phishing attempts which would circumvent any and all security on the login system.
