##What is it?
Brakeman is a static analysis tool which checks Ruby on Rails applications for security vulnerabilities.

Unlike many web security scanners, Brakeman looks at the source code of your application. This means you do not need to set up your whole application stack to use it.

Brakeman can be set to run whenever you save your repo to file, or commit your code to Github. Once Brakeman scans the application code, it produces a report of all security issues it has found.
