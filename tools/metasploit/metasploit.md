# [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)
Kali Linux is an operating system preloaded with a host of pentesting tools including metasploit. It also has network sniffing, social engineering, and back-door making programs. The programs work seamlessly and are usually up to date and ready to go when Kali Linux is downloaded.

Kali Linux is absolutely essential for pentesters. It can be run in a virtual environment or single or dual booted. Most pentesters will have at least one computer with Kali Linx as well as another operating system. 

Kali Linux is an open source project that is maintained and funded by [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/), a provider of world-class information security training and penetration testing services. In addition to Kali Linux, Offensive Security also maintains the Exploit Database and the free online course, [Metasploit Unleashed](http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Main_Page).

# [Metasploit](http://www.metasploit.com/)
The Metasploit Project is a sub-project of the Metasploit Project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development.

It is a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine.

Rather than being one large program, it is a framework of smaller programs much like Rails. It's sole purpose is pentesting and it is considered to be the golden standard of pentesting suites combining top notch anti-forensic tools, pentesting tools, and vulnerability scanners.

## Virtual Environment
Though Metasploit can be installed in any Unix based OS, if you are worried about Metasploit messing up your environment, you can install it into a virtual environment and use it there.
